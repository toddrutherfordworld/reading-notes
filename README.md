Growth mindset means to me...

3 Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset:

  1. Be very deligent in the art of learning! 
  2. Be very persistant in adversifying when coming across obstacles throughout the learning process.  
  3. Stay inspired and driven to achieve your learning goals and career goals.
