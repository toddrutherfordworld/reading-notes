#Class 1 Notes 

Here are my notes about markdown..

## Basic Syntax | Markdown Guide 
Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers
If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.
