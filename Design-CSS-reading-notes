##Design web pages with CSS

As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.

##CSS syntax
CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}

## Things I want to know more about

+ I would love to learn CSS3 and Javascript, adding interactive tables to websites/apps. 
+ CSS modules are nothing very interesting especial how backgroung and border are used in CSS. 
+ I would like to get more familiar with APIs to manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, 
  or manipulating data from other web sites or services.
